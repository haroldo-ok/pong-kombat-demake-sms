MS-DOS "Pong Kombat" demade for the Sega Master System; originally made for the "'So Bad it's Good' Jam 2022"

*This is a work-in-progress.*

## The Story

Way way back in time, PONG was invented.  And it was
Good(tm).  The only real player in the game, white paddle,
enjoyed playing it, and played it well.

Then, with the advent of color gaming systems, other paddles
emerged.  White, being the pompous holier-than-thou jerk he is,
got all uptight about this and left.

He joined the Pong Lao cult, a group of paddle warriors
which held bi-annual tournaments and swap meets.  He eventually
toppled the Pong Lao leader, taking his throne (a mighty chair of
porcelain).  With the aid of his new friend, buddy, and bodyguard
Monolith, he rules over this years' tournament with an iron...
umm... well, paddles lack appendages, so just an iron.

However, with new rainbow-colored paddles from all walks of
life and a few old rivals seeking some revenge entering the
tournament, he may have his hands full.  Hopefully he can turn a
few tricks and save his hide.  Odds are certainly in his favor,
but the forces of Good(tm) have you now.

So don't screw up.
